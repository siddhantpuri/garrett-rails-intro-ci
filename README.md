Modifying RottenPotatoes
========================

[![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/saasbook/rails-intro-ci.svg?token=vryJZs4sjDxvem15eKaQ&branch=master)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/saasbook/rails-intro-ci)


This homework provides a fast-paced intro to Rails by having students
add a couple of simple features to the RottenPotatoes app introduced in
ESaaS.

The students begin with a working version of RP, add new features, and
deploy the improved version to Heroku.  (The grading strategy for the
homework runs remote tests against the Heroku app.)

*Therefore, it's important that students have the GitHub/Heroku
workflows nailed down* before doing this---they should be able to start
from a Rails app working locally and get to the point where they can
deploy it to Heroku.

If they haven't mastered this, consider using Sam Joseph's GitHub/Heroku
Intro homework, elsewhere in this repo, as a prerequisite.
